# COMP 3005 Final Project  
## Health & Fitness Club Management System
## Group of 2: Alex Bon and Gloria Li

This project is a CLI-based Health & Fitness Club Management System built for COMP 3005 (Fall 2025).  
It uses PostgreSQL as the backend DB and Python (psycopg2) as the application for UI

The system supports three roles as stated in specs:
- Member: register, manage profile, track health metrics & goals, and view personal dashboard
- Trainer: set availability and look up member progress
- Admin: (planned) room/class/billing operations for staff.

Course specs:
- Relational DB in PostgreSQL with DDL.sql + DML.sql
- At least 4 Member fns, 2 Trainer fns, and 2 Admin fns (for a 2-person group total ≥10 operations).
- Separate ERD + mapping + normalization documented under `/docs`
